- Pre-trained models for various tasks
- Detailed examples of using AI in real-world scenarios
- Extendable architecture for creating new AI models

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Python**: The core language used
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**: Frameworks for building and training AI models
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these instructions to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- `pip` package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the AI models or train new models as follows:

```bash
python train.py --model your_model_name --data your_dataset_path
```

Refer to the `examples/` folder for more details on usage scenarios and scripts.
